# Authentication System Issues & Fixes

This document outlines critical bugs and issues found in the authentication, splash screen, onboarding, and Supabase integration systems. Each issue includes a detailed AI prompt for resolution.

---

## üö® Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Race Condition in AuthProvider Initialization

**File:** `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx` (lines 47-125)

**Description:** The initial session check and auth state listener setup create a race condition that can cause inconsistent authentication state during app startup.

**Impact:** Users may see flickering between authenticated/unauthenticated states, or authentication may not work reliably on app launch.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Fix the race condition in the AuthProvider component where the initial session check and auth state listener setup happen simultaneously. The issue is in the useEffect hook where:

1. `getInitialSession()` runs asynchronously to check existing session
2. `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` listener is set up immediately after
3. The listener can fire before the initial session check completes

Requirements:
- Ensure the initial session check completes before setting up the auth listener
- Prevent duplicate state updates from racing async operations
- Maintain proper loading states throughout the sequence
- Add proper error handling for both operations
- Ensure the component doesn't render inconsistent states

The fix should sequence these operations properly and use a flag to prevent duplicate state updates.
```

### Issue #2: Double Splash Screen Problem

**Files:**

- `src/app/_layout.tsx` (lines 36-38, 41-43)
- `src/app/index.tsx` (lines 10-12)

**Description:** Two separate splash screens can be displayed simultaneously - one from the root layout and one from the index screen, causing confusing user experience.

**Impact:** Users see multiple splash screens, unexpected transitions, or splash screens that don't hide properly.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Fix the double splash screen issue where both the root layout and index screen can show splash screens simultaneously. Current problems:

1. Root layout shows splash when `!appIsReady && FEATURES.enableSplashOnboarding`
2. Index screen shows splash when `isLoading`
3. Both conditions can be true at the same time

Requirements:
- Consolidate splash screen logic into a single location
- Ensure only one splash screen shows at a time
- Properly sequence app initialization, auth checking, and splash screen hiding
- Maintain smooth transitions between splash, auth, and main app states
- Ensure splash screen always hides appropriately
- Handle all combinations of feature flags and loading states

Create a centralized splash screen state manager that coordinates between app readiness and auth loading states.
```

### Issue #3: Inconsistent Loading State Management

**File:** `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx`

**Description:** Loading states are not properly managed during async auth operations, causing UI inconsistencies and potential race conditions.

**Impact:** Loading indicators may disappear before operations complete, or multiple loading states may conflict.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Fix the inconsistent loading state management in the AuthProvider. Current issues:

1. `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut` set loading to `true` but don't wait for auth state change completion
2. The auth state listener sets `isLoading: false` which might occur before operations complete
3. Loading states can conflict between manual operations and listener updates
4. No proper loading state cleanup on errors

Requirements:
- Ensure loading states remain true until operations fully complete
- Prevent auth state listener from prematurely clearing loading states during operations
- Add operation tracking to distinguish between manual operations and automatic state changes
- Implement proper loading state cleanup on both success and error
- Ensure loading states are consistent across all auth operations
- Add timeout handling for operations that might hang

Create a robust loading state system that properly tracks ongoing operations and their completion.
```

### Issue #4: Missing Profile Creation Error Handling

**File:** `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx` (lines 144-183)

**Description:** The signUp function assumes a database trigger will create user profiles but doesn't handle cases where profile creation fails or the trigger doesn't exist.

**Impact:** Users can be successfully authenticated but have no profile data, breaking app functionality.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Add comprehensive profile creation error handling to the signUp function. Current issues:

1. SignUp assumes database trigger will create profile automatically
2. No verification that profile was actually created
3. No fallback if database trigger fails or doesn't exist
4. Users can end up authenticated but without profiles

Requirements:
- After successful auth signup, verify that profile was created
- If profile creation failed, attempt manual profile creation
- If manual creation fails, provide clear error message and potentially clean up auth user
- Add retry logic for profile creation failures
- Log profile creation issues for debugging
- Ensure consistent profile data structure
- Handle edge cases where auth succeeds but profile operations fail

The solution should guarantee that successful signup results in both authentication and complete profile creation, with proper rollback on failures.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Leak Issues

### Issue #5: Supabase Auth Listener Cleanup

**File:** `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx` (lines 99-124)

**Description:** Auth listener cleanup only happens when Supabase is configured, but the listener might still be created in edge cases, causing memory leaks.

**Impact:** Memory leaks and potential crashes on unmount, especially during development.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Fix potential memory leaks in the Supabase auth listener cleanup. Current issues:

1. Cleanup only happens when `isSupabaseConfigured()` is true
2. Listener might still be created in edge cases even when not configured
3. Cleanup function may not properly handle all scenarios
4. No error handling in cleanup process

Requirements:
- Always properly cleanup auth listeners regardless of configuration state
- Add error handling to the cleanup process
- Ensure cleanup happens in all unmount scenarios
- Add logging to track listener lifecycle
- Handle cases where cleanup might fail
- Prevent listener creation when Supabase is not properly configured

Create a robust cleanup system that prevents memory leaks in all scenarios.
```

### Issue #6: Unused Onboarding Hook

**File:** `src/features/onboarding/hooks/useOnboarding.ts`

**Description:** The useOnboarding hook is defined but never used in the actual onboarding flow, meaning onboarding completion is never tracked.

**Impact:** Users may see onboarding screens repeatedly, onboarding state is never persisted.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Integrate the unused useOnboarding hook into the onboarding flow to properly track completion status. Current issues:

1. `useOnboarding` hook exists but is never used
2. `checkOnboardingStatus` is never called
3. Onboarding completion is never tracked or persisted
4. Users may see onboarding repeatedly

Requirements:
- Integrate useOnboarding hook into OnboardingScreen component
- Call checkOnboardingStatus appropriately to track progress
- Persist onboarding completion state
- Skip onboarding for users who have already completed it
- Add proper error handling for onboarding state operations
- Ensure onboarding state is consistent across app restarts

Connect the onboarding components to the hook to create a complete onboarding tracking system.
```

## üîÑ State Management Issues

### Issue #7: Inconsistent Error Clearing

**Description:** Errors are cleared inconsistently across different auth operations, leading to stale error states.

**Impact:** Users may see old error messages or miss new errors.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Standardize error clearing behavior across all authentication operations. Current issues:

1. Some operations clear errors at start, others don't
2. `resetPassword` clears errors but doesn't set loading state
3. Auth state listener clears errors on any state change
4. Inconsistent error handling patterns across operations

Requirements:
- Standardize error clearing timing across all auth operations
- Clear errors at the start of new operations
- Maintain errors until operations complete (success or new error)
- Add proper error state management for all async operations
- Ensure error states don't persist inappropriately
- Add error logging for debugging

Create a consistent error management system for all authentication operations.
```

### Issue #8: Profile Loading Race Condition

**File:** `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx` (lines 32-44, 104-108)

**Description:** Profile loading happens in multiple places without proper synchronization, potentially causing duplicate requests or inconsistent state.

**Impact:** Multiple API calls, inconsistent profile data, or missing profile information.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Fix the profile loading race condition where profile data is loaded from multiple places simultaneously. Current issues:

1. Initial session check loads profile data
2. Auth state change listener also loads profile data
3. Both can happen simultaneously without coordination
4. Potential for duplicate API calls or inconsistent state

Requirements:
- Coordinate profile loading to prevent duplicate requests
- Ensure profile data is loaded exactly once per auth state change
- Add proper loading states for profile operations
- Handle profile loading errors gracefully
- Cache profile data appropriately
- Add retry logic for failed profile loads

Create a centralized profile loading system that eliminates race conditions and duplicate requests.
```

**Description:** Auth layout returns null during loading states, which can cause navigation issues and blank screens.

**Impact:** Users may see blank screens or experience navigation failures during loading states.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Add proper navigation guards and loading states to the auth layout. Current issues:

1. Auth layout returns `null` during loading, causing blank screens
2. No proper loading component for auth state checking
3. Potential navigation issues when transitioning between states
4. No error handling for navigation failures

Requirements:
- Replace `null` returns with appropriate loading components
- Add proper navigation guards that handle all auth states
- Ensure smooth transitions between loading, authenticated, and unauthenticated states
- Add error boundaries for navigation failures
- Handle edge cases where auth state is indeterminate
- Provide user feedback during all loading states

Create robust navigation guards that provide proper user feedback in all scenarios.
```

### Issue #10: Hard-coded Route Navigation

**File:** `src/features/onboarding/components/OnboardingScreen.tsx` (lines 18, 25)

**Description:** Routes are hard-coded without checking if they exist, potentially causing navigation errors.

**Impact:** App crashes or navigation failures if routes change or don't exist.

**AI Fix Prompt:**

```
Replace hard-coded route navigation with dynamic route checking and error handling. Current issues:

1. Routes like `'/(auth)/login'` are hard-coded
2. No checking if routes actually exist
3. No error handling for navigation failures
4. Brittle navigation that breaks if routes change

Requirements:
- Create a route constants file with all app routes
- Add route validation before navigation attempts
- Implement error handling for failed navigation
- Add fallback routes for missing destinations
- Make navigation more maintainable and type-safe
