Design Philosophy: "Modern Warm Minimalism"

Your app follows a sophisticated, warm minimalist design with these key
characteristics:

🎨 Color Strategy

- Warm Palettes: Cream-tinted whites (250,250,249) and purple-tinted darks
(15,15,17)
- High Contrast Layering: Pure white cards against off-white backgrounds
- Consistent Brand Color: Blue-500 (#3b82f6) across all themes
- Thoughtful Grays: Carefully chosen muted colors for accessibility

📱 Mobile-First Typography

- Enhanced Readability: Larger font sizes (17px base instead of 16px)
- Optimal Line Height: 24px line-height for comfortable reading
- Semantic Hierarchy: Clear distinction between headers, body, and labels

🏗️ Layout Principles
- Bottom-Heavy UI: Key actions placed at bottom for thumb accessibility
- Generous Spacing: 16px-24px padding for comfortable touch targets
- Rounded Corners: Consistent 8px-16px border radius for modern feel
- Platform-Aware: Different shadow/elevation systems per platform

🎬 Animation Style

- Subtle & Smooth: 200-300ms timing with easing
- Context-Aware: FadeIn for messages, Layout transitions for dynamic content
- Performance-First: Reanimated v3 with proper worklet optimization
