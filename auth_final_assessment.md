   - Proper completion logic tied to authentication state changes
   - No premature loading state clearing

4. **‚úÖ Profile Creation Error Handling** - **FIXED**
   - Profile creation verification after signup
   - Manual profile creation fallback if database trigger fails
   - Comprehensive error handling with rollback attempt
   - Complete profile data structure with validation

### üîÑ **Phase 2 High-Priority Fixes - COMPLETED**

5. **‚úÖ Memory Leak Prevention**
   - Proper auth listener cleanup with mounted reference tracking
   - Storage adapter with fallback to prevent memory issues
   - Comprehensive cleanup in all unmount scenarios

6. **‚úÖ Onboarding Integration**
   - `useOnboarding` hook properly integrated into `OnboardingScreen`
   - Onboarding completion tracking and persistence
   - Route validation and safe navigation

7. **‚úÖ Navigation Guards**
   - Replaced `null` returns with proper loading components
   - Type-safe route constants and validation
   - Proper auth state checking in all layouts

8. **‚úÖ Session Management**
   - Automatic session refresh 5 minutes before expiry
   - Session refresh failure handling with auto-logout
   - Storage adapter with robust error handling and fallback

9. **‚úÖ Error Handling Improvements**
   - Consistent error clearing patterns
   - Profile loading deduplication
   - Field-level validation in forms
   - Comprehensive error boundaries

## üîç **Current System Architecture Assessment**

### **Strengths:**

- **Robust State Management**: Operation tracking prevents race conditions
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions and proper loading states
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with validation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and leak prevention
- **Session Security**: Automatic refresh and secure storage
- **Feature Flags**: Flexible configuration system

### **Code Quality Metrics:**

- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean (no errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ESLint**: Minor warnings only (unused variables, formatting)
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive coverage
- ‚úÖ **Testing Ready**: Well-structured for unit/integration tests

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Minor Cleanup Recommendations (Before UI Design)**

### **1. ESLint Cleanup (5 minutes)**

```bash
# Fix the formatting error and unused variables
npm run lint:fix
```

**Issues to address:**

- Prettier formatting in `routes.ts`
- Unused variables in `AuthForm.tsx` (errors, clearErrors, authError)
- Unused `isDark` variables in various components
- React hooks dependency warnings in `AuthProvider.tsx`

### **2. React Hooks Dependencies (10 minutes)**

**File**: `src/features/auth/components/AuthProvider.tsx`

**Issue**: Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks

```typescript
// Lines 217 and 474 - Add missing dependencies or use useCallback
```

**Fix**: Add missing dependencies or wrap functions in `useCallback`

### **3. Storage Consistency (5 minutes)**

**File**: `src/features/onboarding/hooks/useOnboarding.ts`

**Issue**: Uses AsyncStorage directly instead of the robust storage adapter

```typescript
// Consider using the same storage adapter pattern as Supabase
```

**Recommendation**: Use the storage adapter from `supabase.ts` for consistency

### **4. Error Display Integration (Optional)**

**Files**: Various form components

**Enhancement**: Ensure all validation errors from `useAuthForm` are displayed in UI

```typescript
// Make sure errors object is properly utilized in AuthForm
```
